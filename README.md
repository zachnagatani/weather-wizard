# Weather Wizard
The Weather Wizard is a weather scraper, using ajax and PHP to gather weather info from <a href="http://www.weather-forecast.com/">weather-forecast.com</a>.

## Usage
To use, download the files to your local machine and run them on a local server (the app uses PHP). Then, simply enter a city (just the city name, with no comma, state, or country afterwards) and hit "Find My Forecast!"
